# EPS200 Injector Needle Testing Software 

EPS200 is a software application simulated from the Bosch software, used for testing injector needles. This software connects to your hardware through the RS232 port, receives sensor information from each needle, and compares it against injector engine standards. It then determines whether the injector is healthy or defective, displaying the results in a diagram and table format.

**Features**

- **Hardware Connectivity:** Connects to injector testing hardware via RS232 port.
- **Real-time Data Analysis:** Receives and processes sensor data in real-time.
- **Standards Comparison:** Compares sensor data against predefined injector engine standards.
- **Result Display:** Shows the health status of the injector needle through diagrams and tables.
- **Legacy Support:** Developed 9 years ago, compatible with older versions of .NET.

**Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET Framework (old versions)
- **Platform:** Windows Forms
